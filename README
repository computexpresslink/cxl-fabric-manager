CXL Fabric Manager (FM) infrastructure

CXL Fabric Manager (FM) is the application logic responsible for
system composition and allocation of resources. The FM can be embedded
in the firmware of a device such as a CXL switch, reside on a host,
or could be run on a Baseboard Management Controller (BMC).
CXL Specification 3.0 defines Fabric Management as: "CXL devices can be
configured statically or dynamically via a Fabric Manager (FM),
an external logical process that queries and configures the system’s
operational state using the FM commands defined in this specification.
The FM is defined as the logical process that decides when
reconfiguration is necessary and initiates the commands to perform
configurations. It can take any form, including, but not limited to,
software running on a host machine, embedded software running on a BMC,
embedded firmware running on another CXL device or CXL switch,
or a state machine running within the CXL device itself.".

CXL devices are configured by FM through the Fabric Manager Application
Programming Interface (FM API) command sets through a CCI (Component
Command Interface). A CCI is exposed through a device’s Mailbox registers
or through an MCTP-capable (Management Component Transport Protocol)
interface.

FM API Commands (defined by CXL Specification 3.0):
(1) Physical switch
    - Identify Switch Device,
    - Get Physical Port State,
    - Physical Port Control,
    - Send PPB (PCI-to-PCI Bridge) CXL.io Configuration Request.
(2) Virtual Switch
    - Get Virtual CXL Switch Info,
    - Bind vPPB (Virtual PCI-to-PCI Bridge),
    - Unbind vPPB,
    - Generate AER (Advanced Error Reporting Event).
(3) MLD Port
    - Tunnel Management Command,
    - Send LD (Logical Device) or FMLD (Fabric Manager-owned Logical Device)
      CXL.io Configuration Request,
    - Send LD CXL.io Memory Request.
(4) MLD Components
    - Get LD (Logical Device) Info,
    - Get LD Allocations,
    - Set LD Allocations,
    - Get QoS Control,
    - Set QoS Control,
    - Get QoS Status,
    - Get QoS Allocated Bandwidth,
    - Set QoS Allocated Bandwidth,
    - Get QoS Bandwidth Limit,
    - Set QoS Bandwidth Limit.
(5) Multi- Headed Devices (Get Multi-Headed Info).
(6) DCD (Dynamic Capacity Device) Management
    - Get DCD Info,
    - Get Host Dynamic Capacity Region Configuration,
    - Set Dynamic Capacity Region Configuration,
    - Get DCD Extent Lists,
    - Initiate Dynamic Capacity Add,
    - Initiate Dynamic Capacity Release.

After the initial configuration is complete and a CCI on the switch is
operational, an FM can send Management Commands to the switch.

An FM may perform the following dynamic management actions on a CXL switch:
(1) Query switch information and configuration details,
(2) Bind or Unbind ports,
(3) Register to receive and handle event notifications from the switch
    (e.g., hot plug, surprise removal, and failures).

A switch with MLD (Multi-Logical Device) requires an FM to perform
the following management activities:
(1) MLD discovery,
(2) LD (Logical Device) binding/unbinding,
(3) Management Command Tunneling.

The FM can connect to an MLD (Multi-Logical Device) over a direct connection or
by tunneling its management commands through the CCI of the CXL switch
to which the device is connected. The FM can perform the following
operations:
(1) Memory allocation and QoS Telemetry management,
(2) Security (e.g., LD erasure after unbinding),
(3) Error handling.
